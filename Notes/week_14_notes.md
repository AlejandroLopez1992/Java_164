## 2D Arrays

- Arrays with objects
  - Primitives- values are stored
  - objects - references to the values are stores

- 2D
  - Array of array
  - same type
  - Very common
    - enough that we have a shorthand notation
  - example : int[][] arr2D = {{1,2,3}, {6,7,8}, {12,13,14}}

- Declaring without initializing without default values -
  - example: int[][] = new int[3][3];
  - This will initialize an array with three spots, and each of those 3 indexes will have an array with 3 indexes.
