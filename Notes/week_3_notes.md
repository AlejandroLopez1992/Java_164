## Loops

- Types
  - While loops
    - Good when: your iteration variable is created outside of the loop
    - You need your iterator variable outside of the loop
  - For Loops
    - Good when: your loop has a set start and end
    - You don't need to keep your iterator outside the loop
    - for (variables; condition; iterator) {block of code}
      - ++i = pre-incrementation of iterator
      - i++ = post-incrementation of iterator
  - For each Loops
  - Do while loops
  - All loops have:
    - Iteration control - a way to cycle through the values you want to look at
    - A condition to exit

Practice:

Public class Loops {
    Public static void main(String[] args) {
      input = scrn scanner.in.()
      int totalSum = 0;
      int numCount = 0;

while (input >= 0) {
  numCount += 1;
  totalSum += input;
  average =  totalSum / numCount;

  System.out.println("Total Sum is " + totalSum);
  System.out.println("Average is: "  + average) 
  }
  
}


- UML- Unified modeling language
  - Is a standard language for specyfuying, vizualizing constructing and documenting the artifacts of software systems
    - Class notation - Basics
      - Diagram is divided into three parts
        - Top section is used to name the class
        - Second section is used for show the attributes for the class
        - Third section is used to describe the operations/methods performed by the class
